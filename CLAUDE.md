# MLB Picks Engine — Claude Reference

**Project:** `/Users/marc/Projects/Claude/Projects/Shenron/mlb-picks-engine/`
**What:** Automated MLB betting picks engine. Collects live data, runs 7-agent weighted analysis, sends high-confidence plays to Discord via webhook. No manual intervention day-to-day.

---

## Daily Schedule (launchd)

| Time | Command | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 8:00 AM–5:00 PM (hourly) | `engine.py` | Full re-analysis every hour — dedup blocks resends, lineup penalty (-1 conf) holds borderline picks until lineups confirm |
| 11:00 PM | `engine.py --results` | Grades picks vs final scores; auto-runs `collect_boxscores()` |
| Every 30 min | `monitor.py` | Pitcher scratch monitor — Discord alert on SP change |
| 11:30 PM | `optimizer.py` | Nightly optimizer — analyzes data, implements one improvement (7-day code cooldown) |
| Monday 9:00 AM | `calibrate.py` | Weekly signal calibration — posts Discord report; run with `--apply` to update weights |

Plists at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.marc.mlb-picks-engine.*.plist`. Output logged to `engine.log`.

## CLI Usage

```bash
python3 engine.py              # Full analysis + send picks
python3 engine.py --test       # Dry run — no Discord
python3 engine.py --refresh    # Re-validate sent picks, send updates
python3 engine.py --results    # Grade today's picks after games finish
python3 engine.py --status     # Print 30-day tracking snapshot
python3 engine.py --game X     # 7-agent analysis of game(s) matching team X (bypasses threshold)
python3 engine.py --collect DATE  # Collect post-game boxscores for DATE (YYYY-MM-DD)
python3 engine.py --report          # Re-send nightly report for today (already graded)
python3 engine.py --report DATE     # Re-send nightly report for DATE (YYYY-MM-DD)
```

## Pick Filter

- Min confidence ML: **7/10** (`MIN_CONFIDENCE` in config.py)
- Min confidence O/U: **9/10** (`MIN_CONFIDENCE_OU`) — gap formula only, needs ≥1.5 run gap
- Min edge score: **0.12** (`MIN_EDGE_SCORE`)
- Min EV: **−0.02** (`MIN_EV`)
- Max picks/day: **20** (`MAX_PICKS_PER_DAY`) — ML and O/U tracked independently
- Pick types: `moneyline` | `over` | `under` | `f5_ml`
- SP TBD cap: one SP unknown → max 3/10 (ML + O/U); both unknown → max 1/10
- If nothing qualifies → PASS, nothing sent

## Critical Rules

**All thresholds in config.py** — never hardcode in analysis.py (optimizer reads config.py to tune values). Includes HOME_FIELD_ADVANTAGE and BULLPEN_ERA_RUST_THRESHOLD (moved Apr 16).

**Python 3.9** — no `float | None` union syntax. Use `Optional[float]` or `"float | None"` string annotation. `zoneinfo` is stdlib (no pip install).

**MLB API gotcha** — `schedule?hydrate=boxscore` omits player-level pitcher stats for historical dates. Use `/game/{gamePk}/boxscore` per game instead (verified fix 2026-04-12).

**Mock patch target** — if `fetch_lineup_batting` (or any function) is imported at module level in analysis.py, mock as `analysis.fetch_lineup_batting` not `data_mlb.fetch_lineup_batting`.

**RemoteTrigger is cloud-side** — the 2 AM CEO nightly trigger (`trig_01CAuaYtQCBpWSHfNFnS1gJw`) runs against a fresh GitHub clone, not locally. It survives session restarts. To check if it ran: `git fetch origin && git log origin/main --since="YYYY-MM-DD 02:00"`.

**launchd jobs don't log by default** — none of the plists have `StandardOutPath`. All output goes to `engine.log` via the run_*.sh wrappers. `LastExitStatus = 0` with no `LastRunTime` means the job has never fired since being loaded (likely Mac was asleep at scheduled time).

**pitcher_game_logs / team_game_logs are forward-only** — `collect_boxscores()` is called nightly for yesterday only. If the DB is empty, run `backfill_boxscores.py` (project root) to populate from Apr 1 through yesterday. Safe to re-run (INSERT OR IGNORE).

**DB migration** — use `except sqlite3.OperationalError: pass` (not bare `except Exception`).

**analysis_log re-runs use INSERT + UPDATE** — `save_analysis_log()` inserts on first run, then UPDATE on re-runs to refresh analysis fields while preserving `ml_status`/`ou_status` grading columns. Do not revert to INSERT OR IGNORE.

**O/U confidence is a float before return** — K-rate nudge adds 0.5, bullpen nudge adds 1. Always cast with `int(round(conf))` not `int(conf)` to avoid truncation.

**Wind direction from MLB API is compass** — `_wind_direction_label()` returns `N/NE/E/SE/S/SW/W/NW`. Use these in both `score_weather()` and `_project_score()`. Never use `"out to CF"` style strings.

**database.py is module-level functions** — NOT a class. Uses `get_connection()` per call. `import database as db` in data_mlb.py. See `docs/database.md` for full table/function reference.

**New DB tests pattern** — use `monkeypatch.setattr(database, "DB_PATH", str(tmp_path / "test.db"))`, then call `database.init_db()` and `database.get_connection()` directly. `get_connection()` reads `DB_PATH` (not `DATABASE_PATH`). See `tests/test_database.py`.

**MLB /schedule linescore endpoint** — does NOT return `abbreviation` field, only `team_id`. Use `db.get_team_abbr_by_mlb_id(team_id)` to look up abbreviations from the `teams` table.

**fetch_venue_weather() uses forecast API** — Open-Meteo `/v1/forecast` only returns reliable data for today + future dates. For historical game dates, use `fetch_venue_weather_archive()` (uses `archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive`). `backfill_game_totals_weather()` calls the archive variant and is safe for historical backfill.

**_parse_total_line() returns None on failure** — engine.py O/U grading pushes when total line can't be parsed or is out of range (5–15). Never returns 0.0. If adding new O/U grading paths, always guard: `if total_line is None: status = "push"`.

**SQLite date('now') is local time** — in tests, use `datetime.now().isoformat()` (not `datetime.utcnow()`) for `created_at` inserts, or queries filtering by `date('now')` will miss the row.

**run_results() conn lifecycle** — `conn` is opened at line 609 and closed at line 746 after pick grading. The `mlb_to_local` build block (line 862+) reopens its own conn and closes it. Any new code after line 746 must call `db.get_connection()` fresh — do not reuse the closed conn.
